      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>Hello, my name is Regie Malonzo. I'm 29 years old, originally from the Philippines, and moved to NZ when I was 8 years old. Currently based in North Shore, Auckland. I live a pretty active lifestyle; I enjoy going to the gym in the morning and playing basketball. I strive to maintain a balanced lifestyle between gaming and physical activity. I'm a big fan of FPS games and sports games, and I'm currently playing Valorant and NBA 2K24. </p>
