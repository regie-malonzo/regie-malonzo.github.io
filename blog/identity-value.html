            <h3>Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
            </h3>
            <p>So, there was this time when my close friend did something that really hurt me, you know, like a serious breach of trust. It was tough because we've been tight for over seven years, but what he did made me feel betrayed. I had to think hard about whether our friendship was worth salvaging despite what happened. In the end, I decided to forgive him and move on. Looking back, I'm glad I did. We're still good mates, and it's water under the bridge now.</p>

            <h3>Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</h3>
            <p>Growing up in a close-knit community, I was immersed in a culture that prioritized respect for family and loyalty to those close to us. Observing the behaviors and attitudes of my family and peers, I internalized these values deeply. For instance, witnessing my parents' unwavering support for relatives during challenging times instilled in me a sense of duty towards kinship. Moreover, interactions with friends who valued honesty and integrity reinforced these principles, shaping my identity as someone who values trust and empathy in relationships. These cultural influences continue to guide my decisions and interactions, anchoring me to a set of core values that define my identity.</p>

            <h3>Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.</h3>
            <p>My strengths in kindness, honesty, fairness, and teamwork serve as pillars for my learning journey. Kindness enables me to approach challenges with empathy, fostering a supportive learning environment. Honesty allows me to confront difficulties transparently, facilitating a deeper understanding of concepts. Fairness ensures equitable treatment of peers, promoting collaboration and mutual growth. Additionally, my ability to work effectively in teams harnesses diverse perspectives, enriching the learning experience through collective problem-solving and shared knowledge. These strengths collectively empower me to navigate complexities in my learning journey with resilience and integrity.

            <h3>Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?
            </h3>
            <p>While I acknowledge being new to this field presents challenges, I view it as an opportunity for gradual growth and adaptation. Recognizing the need to approach learning incrementally, I intend to adopt a systematic approach, breaking down concepts into manageable steps to enhance comprehension. Moreover, I am committed to seeking mentorship and resources to bridge knowledge gaps and accelerate my learning curve. Embracing a programmer's mindset entails embracing continuous learning and problem-solving, qualities I aspire to cultivate to overcome obstacles in my career development.

            <h3>Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.
            </h3>
            <p>In my previous role as a warehouse manager, I encountered resistance while training a new employee due to language barriers and the complexity of the tasks. Initially, I attempted to provide comprehensive training sessions, covering all aspects of the job at once. However, this approach proved ineffective as it overwhelmed the trainee and hindered their learning progress. Reflecting on this experience, I realize the importance of adapting my teaching methods to accommodate individual learning styles and pace. Moving forward, I would employ a more structured approach, breaking down tasks into smaller, digestible segments and incorporating visual aids or demonstrations to enhance understanding. By prioritizing clarity and patience, I aim to foster a supportive learning environment conducive to the trainee's success.
