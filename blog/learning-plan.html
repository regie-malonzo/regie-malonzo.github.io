              <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
              <p>
                Its still the same as my foundation goal, to finish the course and be able to find a job in the tech industry as i am trying to change career, but also be confident in my skills that i am able to look for a job.

              <h3>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h3>
              <p>
                I think my strengths and limitations remain the same. I still consider myself to be an open-minded person, trying to absorb as much as I can within the learning process.
                I know that my technical skills will always need more improvement. However, a new limitation I found was my ego, which prevents me from asking for help. I will try to overcome this during bootcamp since it will involve more face-to-face interaction.
               </p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h3>
              <p>
                Some non-technical challenges I might encounter during bootcamp might include being more organized to keep on top of the materials for all nine weeks of bootcamp, 
                needing to focus more on my spiritual wellbeing by having time to reflect during my day and assess how it's going with the course, 
                journaling more, and just being able to get some quiet time when things are going to get stressful.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
              <p>
                I aim to improve my communication skills so that I can ask for help more effectively, collaborate better with others, and overall gain confidence in myself, which will also positively impact my technical skills.
                Additionally, I want to build the confidence to work in a team or pair programming setting, allowing me to improve both giving and receiving feedback.
              </p>

            <div>
              <h3>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h3>
              <p>
                Still the same as my foundation learning plan; To provide the necessary content/information, hold myself accountable during my learning journey, guidance, support and feedback.
              </p>

            <div>
              <h3>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h3>
              <p>
                My expectations include establishing relationships with fellow students in my cohort to foster collaboration and mutual support. 
                Additionally, I aim to engage with facilitators to receive guidance throughout the program.
                I plan to stay on top of my workload to meet deadlines and avoid falling behind.
                Being present and punctual for classes, as well as dedicating extra time outside of hours for additional work, are also priorities.

                <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>

                <h3>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h3>
                <p>
                  I consider myself to be quite open-minded when it comes to learning. I'm always eager to explore new ideas and perspectives, which I believe enriches my understanding of various subjects. 
                  Additionally, I have a strong sense of patience. I don't easily get discouraged when faced with challenges and am willing to invest the time and effort required to overcome obstacles.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I do recognize that I sometimes need a bit more time when it comes to technical skills. I find myself having to go back to instructions or information repeatedly to fully grasp them. 
                  While I'm patient and persistent in my learning journey, technical subjects can sometimes require extra focus and practice for me to truly understand them.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h3>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
                <p>
                  I want to become more confident in myself and my work at Dev Academy. I hope to overcome my fear of judgment and feel comfortable putting myself out there. 
                  This means being more confident in speaking up, sharing my ideas, and presenting my work without worrying too much about what others might think.
                </p>

            <div>
                <h3>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. </h3>
                <p>
                  I'm committed to staying organized and on top of my workload throughout the program. I'll use a weekly planner to keep track of tasks and deadlines, making sure I know what needs to be done each week. 
                  I'll actively participate in homegroup meetings, where I can ask questions and contribute ideas. If I ever feel overwhelmed or stressed, I won't hesitate to reach out for help from my facilitator or classmates. 
                  By staying organized, engaged, and willing to seek assistance when needed, I'm confident I can effectively manage my workload and succeed in the program
                </p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3>
                <p>
                  When I find myself unable to solve a problem after a reasonable amount of time and I notice I'm going on a tangent, I commit to seeking help in a timely manner. 
                  I will first attempt to solve the issue myself by researching and troubleshooting. If I still can't find a solution and realize I'm spending too much time on it, I will promptly reach out to my facilitator or post a question on the Discord channel under the #tech-questions section. 
                  This will ensure that I receive timely assistance and avoid wasting unnecessary time.
                </p>
