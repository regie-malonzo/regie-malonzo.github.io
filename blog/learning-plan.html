                <h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
                <p>My long-term goal is to complete this course and pursue a career in the tech industry as a software developer</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h3>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h3>
                <p>I consider myself to be quite open-minded when it comes to learning. I'm always eager to explore new ideas and perspectives, which I believe enriches my understanding of various subjects. Additionally, I have a strong sense of patience. I don't easily get discouraged when faced with challenges and am willing to invest the time and effort required to overcome obstacles.</p>
                <p> I do recognize that I sometimes need a bit more time when it comes to technical skills. I find myself having to go back to instructions or information repeatedly to fully grasp them. While I'm patient and persistent in my learning journey, technical subjects can sometimes require extra focus and practice for me to truly understand them.</p>

            </div>

            <div>
                <h3>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
                <p>I want to become more confident in myself and my work at Dev Academy. I hope to overcome my fear of judgment and feel comfortable putting myself out there. This means being more confident in speaking up, sharing my ideas, and presenting my work without worrying too much about what others might think.</p>

            </div>

            <div>
                <h3>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. </h3>
                <p>I'm committed to staying organized and on top of my workload throughout the program. I'll use a weekly planner to keep track of tasks and deadlines, making sure I know what needs to be done each week. I'll actively participate in homegroup meetings, where I can ask questions and contribute ideas. If I ever feel overwhelmed or stressed, I won't hesitate to reach out for help from my facilitator or classmates. By staying organized, engaged, and willing to seek assistance when needed, I'm confident I can effectively manage my workload and succeed in the program</p>

            </div>

            <div>
                <h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3>
                <p>When I find myself unable to solve a problem after a reasonable amount of time and I notice I'm going on a tangent, I commit to seeking help in a timely manner. I will first attempt to solve the issue myself by researching and troubleshooting. If I still can't find a solution and realize I'm spending too much time on it, I will promptly reach out to my facilitator or post a question on the Discord channel under the #tech-questions section. This will ensure that I receive timely assistance and avoid wasting unnecessary time.</p>

            </div>

            <div>
                <h3>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
                <p>To provide the necessary content/information, hold myself accountable during my learning journey, guidance, support and feedback.</p>

               </div>
            
            <div>
                <h3>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h3>
                <p>wedding i have to attend but i will plan the week accordingly and get my work done before that day.</p>
