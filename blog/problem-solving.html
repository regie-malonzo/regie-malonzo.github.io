                <h2>Blocked on a simple problem:</h2>
                <p>
                    I ran into a few simple problems during this task. One of them occurred while manipulating objects. The task required adding Terah's children to a new key along with their respective values.
                    Initially, I attempted to add them directly under the children key. However, upon checking, an error emerged.
                    So, I had to revisit the instructions and the expected outcome from the terminal, breaking down what was being asked. I realized that I needed to assign each of the children's names under terah.children with their own property and value. <br>
                    Throughout the process, I felt somewhat frustrated and found myself second-guessing what I was doing wrong. However, once I pinpointed my mistake, a sense of relief washed over me, and I understood what needed to happen.
                    I learned the importance of calming down, slowing down, and breaking the problem into smaller parts. I also realized that error messages are helpful in identifying where things went wrong and understanding what the code expects.
