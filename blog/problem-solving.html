                <h2>Blocked on a simple problem:</h2>
                <p>
                    I ran into a few simple problems during this task. One of them occurred while manipulating objects. The task required adding Terah's children to a new key along with their respective values.
                    Initially, I attempted to add them directly under the children key. However, upon checking, an error emerged.
                    So, I had to revisit the instructions and the expected outcome from the terminal, breaking down what was being asked. I realized that I needed to assign each of the children's names under terah.children with their own property and value. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Throughout the process, I felt somewhat frustrated and found myself second-guessing what I was doing wrong. However, once I pinpointed my mistake, a sense of relief washed over me, and I understood what needed to happen.
                    I learned the importance of calming down, slowing down, and breaking the problem into smaller parts. I also realized that error messages are helpful in identifying where things went wrong and understanding what the code expects.

                <h2>Elegantly solved a problem</h2>
                <p>
                    A problem I elegantly solved was during Gradebook Question 3, which involved adding a new property with a key <em>'testScores'</em>. Initially, I attempted to directly input the scores into the student's object literals along with the corresponding array positions of their scores.
                    However, I encountered an error as I wasn't supposed to do that. So, I had to review the question and see what it was asking for. It turned out that I needed to add a new property and its value. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The correction transformed <em><strong>gradebook.Joseph = {score[0]} into gradebook.Joseph.testScore = (scores[0])</strong></em>. It felt really satisfying once I figured it out. Again, it reinforced the importance of looking at things properly and breaking them down.

                <h2>Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes:</h2>
                <p>
                    Being new at this, I've never really used most of these methods, and I just need to practice and apply them during my learning so that I can be more confident in progressing through these challenges.
                    The problem-solving techniques/processes I tend to use more are trying something so that it gives me an indication of what's going on and where I need to go from there, so I end up Googling things a lot to get an understanding.

                    <strong>Areas of practice to help improve my problem-solving skills:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Pseudocode</li>
                        <li>Console logging</li>
                        <li>Rubber duck method</li>
                        <li>Reading error messages</li>
                        <li>Asking your peers for help</li>
                        <li>Asking coaches for help</li>
                        <li>Improving your process with reflection</li>

                <h2>Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made you reluctant to do so. What might you try differently next time?</h2>
                <p>
                    During the challenge, I tend to tackle the problem on my own because I lack the confidence to ask for help from others. Perhaps it's due to my own thinking that I might not be doing it right and wouldn't want to waste anyone's time.
                    Or sometimes, I check if someone else has raised a similar question and see if it aligns with where I'm at.
                    However, next time, I need to try approaching it differently by explaining my question properly, detailing where I'm stuck with my work, and asking for help in the group chats.
