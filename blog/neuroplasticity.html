            <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2><br>
            <h3>How does understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefit people?</h3>
              <p>
                That both physical and mental are link together, anything you do mentally can have the same outcome as a physical practice. 
                The more you apply yourself in the process the better the outcome may be for you.
              </p><br>
            <h3>How might you engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your own benefit?</h3>
                <p> 
                  Being able to change my mindset that just because it's not working at the moment it doesn't mean I've failed. neuroplasticity allows your brain to learn something for failure/mistake. 
                  The more i practice and apply my process of understanding the better i am able to change that.
                </p><br>
            <h3>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h3>
                <p>
                  some ways i can increase my neuroplasticity is by researching, practice and applying all of those into my learning and also the way i live.

        <h2>Growth Mindset</h2><br>
        <h3>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant</h3>
          <p>
            I found it relevant because growing up I've always had a "fix mindset" can only do things I'm capable of, didn't want to "fail" if i found it too hard i automatically find myself shutting down. 
            Once reading and looking into growth mindset and the power of "yet" i can go into this course with a different perspective. 
            To go for the challenges about to be set, find the process of understanding.
          </p><br>
        <h3>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h3>
         <p>
          Yes i believe that it did surprise me because of the way i was brought up and thinking how it was always fail or succeed.
        </p><br>
        <h3>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h3>
          <p>
            To go into this course with a growth mindset by having an open mind about the process and ask for help. Trial and error, giving it my 100%

        <h2>Blend with your learning plan and strategies</h2>
                <h3>Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy.</h3>
                    <p>Having researched and finding that both Neuroplasticity and Growth mindset can help me during my learning journey and life in general just by thinking that failure and mistake doesnt mean the end of the world but more of a learning experience to try new things and see how i can improve, also just to have an open mind when encountering new challenges.</p>
