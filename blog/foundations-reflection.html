                <h3>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h3>
                <p>
                    During the foundation, I've discovered several things about myself. Firstly, I've realized that I have much to learn, and sometimes I fall into a fixed mindset where things seem overwhelming.
                    However, I've learned to be kind to myself and recognize that this is a foundation course; it's normal to be in a learning process. Additionally, I've learned to focus on my 'why' and my goals for undertaking this journey. <br> <br>
                    Secondly, I've learned not to allow myself to get stuck on one thing and spiral downward.Instead, I've discovered the importance of taking a step back, giving myself a break, taking deep breaths, and approaching the problem from a different perspective. <br><br>
                    Lastly, I've come to realize that I do have an ego, but it's essential to let it go when necessary. If I find myself stuck, I've learned to ask for help from my peers and facilitators, recognizing that seeking assistance is a sign of strength, not weakness.

                <h3>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
                <p>
                    Everyone holds different values in life, influenced by their unique stages in learning and programming. Values help us set goals that align with what matters most to us. 
                    They also guide our behavior and decision-making processes in both learning and programming. <br>
                    Empathy enables us to connect with others, fostering understanding and improving teamwork. <br>
                    Self-awareness helps us recognize our strengths and weaknesses, leading to better problem-solving and coding skills by acknowledging our biases and learning preferences.

                <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
                <p>
                    What has surprised me the most about the core learning is my ability to write about myself and discover new insights. 
                    For instance, during research on neuroplasticity and the growth mindset, I realized that my earlier education had focused more on a fixed mindset, where the emphasis was on the end results rather than the learning journey itself. 
                    This new perspective allowed me to recognize the importance of embracing challenges and learning from them, ultimately enabling me to grow and acquire new knowledge.

                <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
                <p>
                    The most challenging aspects of the core learning were having to delve deep into myself and articulate personal experiences. I've never been inclined to write about myself, let alone discussing ethical decisions I've made in the past or reflecting on my identity and values.
                     These tasks presented significant challenges during the core learning process.
                </p>

            <div>
                <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h3>
                <p>
                    I believe it's because it enables students to develop communication and interpersonal skills. No one wants to work with someone who lacks communication or interpersonal skills. 
                    Therefore, being able to develop our core skills during the course sets us up for better communication, teamwork, and understanding of one another.

                <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
                <p>
                    No, I don't consider the time spent studying core learning here as a waste of time. It provided valuable insights and allowed me to discover new aspects about myself. 
                    While practicing programming is undoubtedly important, dedicating time to core learning offered benefits beyond technical skills. It helped me develop self-awareness, understand my learning process better, and gain insights into areas like mindset and values that ultimately contribute to overall personal and professional growth.
                     So, while programming practice is crucial, the time invested in core learning was well justified for the broader development it facilitated.
