                <h1>JavaScript Fundamentals</h1>
            </div> 

            <div>
                <h3>JavaScript, HTML and CSS Analogy:</h3>
                <p>Imagine building a website is like assembling a sports team for a game. HTML is like the players – they form the foundation of the team, each player representing a different position on the field. CSS is like the team uniform – it gives the players a cohesive look and style, making them recognizable and appealing to the audience.</p><br>
                <p>Now, JavaScript is like the coach and strategy behind the team. The coach decides on the game plan, orchestrates plays, and communicates with players in real-time. JavaScript adds dynamics to the game, just like how the coach adapts strategies based on the opponent's moves and the game situation. It allows the team to execute complex maneuvers, coordinate movements, and respond to changing circumstances on the field.</p><br>
                <p>Just as a coach can call for specific plays, formations, and tactics during a game, JavaScript enables elements on the webpage to react to user interactions, trigger animations, and update content dynamically. It's the driving force behind the team's performance, making the website dynamic, interactive, and engaging, much like a thrilling sports match.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h3>Control flow and loops:</h3>
                <p>Control flow refers to the order in which the individual statements, instructions, or function calls of a program are executed. It determines the direction of program execution based on conditions and logic.
                    Loops are control flow structures that allow a set of instructions to be executed repeatedly until a specific condition is met.
                    </p><br>
                <p>Control flow is like following a set of instruction step by step.Each step depends on the outcome of the previous one. It's like following directions to make a sandwich: first, you grab bread, then you add peanut butter, then jelly, and finally, you put the two slices together.</p><br>
                <p>Think of loop like doing something over and over again untill your satisfied with the results. Like practicing basketball free throws you keep doing it untill you reached the certain makes you set out.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h3>what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.</h3>
                <p>The Document Object Model(DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. Represents the document as a tree like structure, where each node represents an element, attribute or text in the document. The DOM provides a way for programs to dynamically access and manipulate the content, structure, and style of the web document. One way you can access the DOM is through the built-in developer tool(DevTool) in a browser which most modern browsers have. You can open the developer tools by right-clicking anywhere on a webpage and selecting "Inspect" or by pressing Ctrl + Shift + I (or Cmd + Option + I on Mac) on your keyboard. </p>

            </div>

            <div>
                <h3>Accessing Data from Arrays and Objects:</h3>
                <p>Imagine an array like a row of numbered boxes, each containing something different.You find what's in a box by saying, "Give me what's in box number 2," and you'd get whatever is stored there, like "Sprite".</p><br>
                <p>Think of objects like a set of labeled drawers. Each drawer has something inside.To get something from a drawer, you say, "Give me what's in the drawer labeled 'Sprite'," and you'd get whatever is stored there, like its price or ingredients.
                </p>
                <p>Arrays are like numbered boxes, where you ask for something by its position. <br>
                Objects are like labeled drawers, where you ask for something by its label.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h3>Function:</h3>
                <p>A function is like a set of instructions in the recipe. It's a reusable block of code that performs a specific task. So instead of rewriting the same code every time you want to do something, you can put it in a function and call that function whenever you need to perform that task. It helps keep your code organized, easier to understand, and saves you from repeating yourself.</p>
